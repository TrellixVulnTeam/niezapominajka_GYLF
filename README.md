# Niezapominajka (Forget-me-not)

## Description and authors

This is where history is made... \
Plants from all over the world can breathe a sigh of relief...\
There will no longer be a situation in which the owner forgets about watering... \
And all this thanks to our application... \
Many functions and the a user-friendly interface will make it a pleasure to use.
And there's nothing better than combining duty with pleasure, right?
